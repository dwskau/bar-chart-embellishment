[{"story":"<p>THE patient was a fairly young woman and she'd had cancer for as long as her youngest child had been alive. That child was now walking and talking and her mother's cancer had spread throughout her body to the point where there were no more curative options. Aggressive growth of the disease in her brain had stripped her of her personality and her memories.</p><p>She had another child, too, a few years older, and a husband whose drawn eyes and tense frame bore the strain of trying to keep it all together. Extended family lived far away and couldn't be brought closer. The husband and kids lived more than an hour's drive from the hospital.</p><p>No one could say for sure how long she would live, but continued hospital care was clearly pointless. Nor could she go home: she needed more attention than her family could provide. Everyone - her physician, the husband, the palliative care team, we nurses - agreed she needed inpatient hospice care, and that it should be provided close to home.</p><p>The problem was, she had no place to go. There was a hospice facility near her house, but it would accept her only if she would die within six days.</p><p>I've run up against these kinds of time limits before in my work as an oncology nurse. There's a certain logic to it: hospice insurance benefits are ideally used to cover the costs of end-of-life care in patients' homes, for up to six months, while periods of inpatient care are for the &quot;short term.&quot; And although patients do die in inpatient hospices, part of the mission of hospice is allowing patients to remain at home instead of in a hospital; hence the turn away from inpatient care, which is costly and often intrusive.</p><p>But that leaves people like this patient - more than a few days away from death, unable to be adequately cared for at home and unable to afford to pay out-of-pocket for a facility - struggling to find a place to die.</p><p>Dying at home was neither safe nor compassionate for this patient. She needed constant supervision: she would struggle to sit up and moan in frustration, or lurch dangerously over the side of the bed. Her speech was more sounds than words, and she had no control over her bowels or bladder.</p><p>Her husband looked as if he might fold in on himself at any minute, and he'd already borne the burden of care for a long time. Though I didn't know for sure, it's likely that his insurance couldn't guarantee continuous nursing care in the home as a covered expense. And the patient's children had already lost so much of their mother; she no longer even recognized them. Did they need to witness her final deterioration up close at home?</p><p>Home was not the only option. She could have stayed in the hospital and pursued aggressive care. Indeed, if her physician or a family member had said &quot;do everything,&quot; meaning keep her alive as long as possible through intravenous medications and hydration and, ultimately, sending her to the intensive care unit on a ventilator, it would have cost thousands of dollars but, paradoxically, most insurance companies would have considered it a legitimate care option.</p><p>Doing everything possible to extend her life wouldn't have benefited her or her family, though. Roughly a third of family members of I.C.U. patients show symptoms of post-traumatic stress, according to research by the French intensive-care expert Elie Azoulay and his collaborators. If a loved one dies in intensive care after discussions about advance directives and patient wishes - that is, after the family has been made fully aware of the finality of the situation - the psychological fallout is even greater, approaching 80 percent. We do not always aid the living by inflicting high-tech ministrations on the almost-dead.</p><p>In other words, inpatient hospice care made sense medically, financially and psychologically for this patient, but the system simply wouldn't allow it.</p><p>The only option, then, was for me to convince the hospice staff that she would die within six days. I spoke with the inpatient coordinator, the administrator and the hospice admissions nurse, who came to the hospital floor to assess the patient.</p><p>My explanations were precise: &quot;She's on an antibiotic now, but that'll stop in hospice so she could go septic. Her kidney function is already diminished; kidney failure is only a matter of time. She has periods of difficulty breathing, and hospice won't have the respiratory support she'll need, but you can give her morphine to stop the air hunger.&quot;</p><p>All of us will at some point come to this pass; we will all need a place to die. It's not easy to think about, but it is true. We can turn away from that hard fact, try to stall death, even bend it to our will for a little while in the I.C.U. Or we can face that most difficult of life's trials and ask ourselves how to make it easier.</p><p>With this patient I ended up being persuasive enough, and she got her inpatient admission. Was she dead in six days? Probably; I don't know for sure. What I do know is that her sad husband and two young children, who would never really know their mother, had a chance to grieve and say goodbye in the most humane way possible for them.</p>","question":"What type of nurse was the author?", "choices":["pediatric", "neo-natal", "oncology", "cardiac"],"answer":"oncology"},
{"story":"<p>During this past year I've had three instances of car trouble: a blowout on a freeway, a bunch of blown fuses and an out-of-gas situation. They all happened while I was driving other people's cars, which for some reason makes it worse on an emotional level. And on a practical level as well, what with the fact that I carry things like a jack and extra fuses in my own car, and know enough not to park on a steep incline with less than a gallon of fuel.</p><p>Each time, when these things happened, I was disgusted with the way people didn't bother to help. I was stuck on the side of the freeway hoping my friend's roadside service would show, just watching tow trucks cruise past me. The people at the gas stations where I asked for a gas can told me that they couldn't lend them out &quot;for safety reasons,&quot; but that I could buy a really crappy one-gallon can, with no cap, for $15. It was enough to make me say stuff like &quot;this country is going to hell in a handbasket,&quot; which I actually said.</p><p>But you know who came to my rescue all three times? Immigrants. Mexican immigrants. None of them spoke any English.</p><p>One of those guys stopped to help me with the blowout even though he had his whole family of four in tow. I was on the side of the road for close to three hours with my friend's big Jeep. I put signs in the windows, big signs that said, &quot;NEED A JACK,&quot; and offered money. Nothing. Right as I was about to give up and start hitching, a van pulled over, and the guy bounded out.</p><p>He sized up the situation and called for his daughter, who spoke English. He conveyed through her that he had a jack but that it was too small for the Jeep, so we would need to brace it. Then he got a saw from the van and cut a section out of a big log on the side of the road. We rolled it over, put his jack on top and we were in business.</p><p>I started taking the wheel off, and then, if you can believe it, I broke his tire iron. It was one of those collapsible ones, and I wasn't careful, and I snapped the head clean off. Damn.</p><p>No worries: he ran to the van and handed it to his wife, and she was gone in a flash down the road to buy a new tire iron. She was back in 15 minutes. We finished the job with a little sweat and cussing (the log started to give), and I was a very happy man.</p><p>The two of us were filthy and sweaty. His wife produced a large water jug for us to wash our hands in. I tried to put a 20 in the man's hand, but he wouldn't take it, so instead I went up to the van and gave it to his wife as quietly as I could. I thanked them up one side and down the other. I asked the little girl where they lived, thinking maybe I'd send them a gift for being so awesome. She said they lived in Mexico. They were in Oregon so Mommy and Daddy could pick cherries for the next few weeks. Then they were going to pick peaches, then go back home.</p><p>After I said my goodbyes and started walking back to the Jeep, the girl called out and asked if I'd had lunch. When I told her no, she ran up and handed me a tamale.</p><p>This family, undoubtedly poorer than just about everyone else on that stretch of highway, working on a seasonal basis where time is money, took a couple of hours out of their day to help a strange guy on the side of the road while people in tow trucks were just passing him by.</p><p>But we weren't done yet. I thanked them again and walked back to my car and opened the foil on the tamale (I was starving by this point), and what did I find inside? My $20 bill! I whirled around and ran to the van and the guy rolled down his window. He saw the $20 in my hand and just started shaking his head no. All I could think to say was, &quot;Por favor, por favor, por favor,&quot; with my hands out. The guy just smiled and, with what looked like great concentration, said in English: &quot;Today you, tomorrow me.&quot;</p><p>Then he rolled up his window and drove away, with his daughter waving to me from the back. I sat in my car eating the best tamale I've ever had, and I just started to cry. It had been a rough year; nothing seemed to break my way. This was so out of left field I just couldn't handle it.</p><p>In the several months since then I've changed a couple of tires, given a few rides to gas stations and once drove 50 miles out of my way to get a girl to an airport. I won't accept money. But every time I'm able to help, I feel as if I'm putting something in the bank.</p>","question":"How much money did the person offer the immigrant?", "choices": ["$15", "$20", "$50", "$35"], "answer": "$20"},
{"story":"<p>A well-known scientist once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: &quot;What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise.&quot; The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, &quot;What is the tortoise standing on.&quot; &quot;You're very clever, young man, very clever,&quot; said the old lady. &quot;But it's turtles all the way down!&quot;</p><p>Most people would find the picture of our universe as an infinite tower of tortoises rather ridiculous, but why do we think we know better? What do we know about the universe, and how do we know it? Where did the universe come from, and where is it going? Did the universe have a beginning, and if so, what happened before then? What is the nature of time? Will it ever come to an end? Can we go back in time? Recent breakthroughs in physics, made possible in part by fantastic new technologies, suggest answers to some of these longstanding questions. Someday these answers may seem as obvious to us as the earth orbiting the sun - or perhaps as ridiculous as a tower of tortoises. Only time (whatever that may be) will tell.</p><p>As long ago as 340 BC the Greek philosopher Aristotle, was able to put forward two good arguments for believing that the earth was a round sphere rather than a flat plate. First, he realized that eclipses of the moon were caused by the earth coming between the sun and the moon. The earth's shadow on the moon was always round, which would be true only if the earth was spherical. If the earth had been a flat disk, the shadow would have been elongated and elliptical, unless the eclipse always occurred at a time when the sun was directly under the center of the disk. Second, the Greeks knew from their travels that the North Star appeared lower in the sky when viewed in the south than it did in more northerly regions. The Greeks even had a third argument that the earth must be round, for why else does one first see the sails of a ship coming over the horizon, and only later see the hull?</p><p>Aristotle thought the earth was stationary and that the sun, the moon, the planets, and the stars moved in circular orbits about the earth. He believed this because he felt, for mystical reasons, that the earth was the center of the universe, and that circular motion was the most perfect. The earth stood at the center, surrounded by eight spheres that carried the moon, the sun, the stars, and the five planets known at the time, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The planets themselves moved on smaller circles attached to their respective spheres in order to account for their rather complicated observed paths in the sky. The outermost sphere carried the so-called fixed stars, which always stay in the same positions relative to each other but which rotate together across the sky. What lay beyond the last sphere was never made very clear, but it certainly was not part of mankind's observable universe.</p><p>Another model, was proposed in 1514 by a Polish priest, Nicholas Copernicus. His idea was that the sun was stationary at the center and that the earth and the planets moved in circular orbits around the sun. Nearly a century passed before this idea was taken seriously. Then two astronomers - the German, Johannes Kepler, and the Italian, Galileo Galilei - started publicly to support the Copernican theory, despite the fact that the orbits it predicted did not quite match the ones observed. The death blow to the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic theory came in 1609. In that year, Galileo started observing the night sky with a telescope, which had just been invented. When he looked at the planet Jupiter, Galileo found that it was accompanied by several small satellites or moons that orbited around it. This implied that everything did not have to orbit directly around the earth, as Aristotle had thought. (It was, of course, still possible to believe that the earth was stationary at the center of the universe and that the moons of Jupiter moved on extremely complicated paths around the earth, giving the appearance that they orbited Jupiter. However, Copernicus's theory was much simpler.) At the same time, Johannes Kepler had modified Copernicus's theory, suggesting that the planets moved not in circles but in ellipses (an ellipse is an elongated circle). The predictions now finally matched the observations.</p>","question":"When did Aristotle put forward his arguments that the earth was round?", "choices": ["340BC", "300AD", "1300BC", "700AD"], "answer": "340BC"}]
