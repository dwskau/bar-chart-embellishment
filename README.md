Bar Chart Embellishment Evaluation
========

This project was used in a study that used the Mechanical Turk platform to test a series of bar chart embellishments for the paper: Drew Skau, Lane Harrison, Robert Kosara, [An Evaluation of the Impact of Visual Embellishments in Bar Charts](http://kosara.net/publications/Skau-EuroVis-2015.html), _Computer Graphics Forum (Proceedings EuroVis)_, vol. 34, no. 3, pp. 221â€“230, 2015.

The study is built on the excellent [Experimentr.js project](https://github.com/codementum/experimentr/blob/master/public/experimentr.js).


Both data files showing the resulting data are available in the data directory. This is a summary of the data fields in the Bars Data file, the Demographics are pretty self-explanatory:

|Field Name|Description|
|--------|--------|
| _time_start_time-trial_ | Unix time for beginning of the question |
| _bars_ |(For relative questions) Which of the three bars were being asked about |
| _time_end_time-trial_	| Unix time for ending of the question (if this is missing, it is the same as time_end_trials from the demographics data)|
| _bar_ | (For absolute questions) Which of the three bars was being asked about |
| _data-trial_ | The data used for each bar |
| _number-in-series_ | Position within a given chart type |
| _log-error_ | Log absolute error as reported in the paper |
| _totalSequence_ | Position within the entire study for that participant |
| _question-trial_ | Abbreviated plain english version of the question |
| _judged-true_ | Judged answer minus true answer |
| _ans-percentage-diff_ | (given-correct)/correct |
| _max-mid-min_ | whether the bar in question was the tallest, middle, or shortest |
| _number-in-section_ | Position within absolute or relative questions |
| _adjacent_ | (For relative questions) Whether the bar in question was adjacent to the one it was compared to |
| _question-type_ | Absolute or Relative |
| _ans-trial_ | Given answer |
| _postID_ | ID generated by experimentr |
| _chart-embellishment_ | Embellishment name |
| _time_diff_time-trial_ | Time in miliseconds that it took to answer the question |
| _correctAns-trial_ | Correct answer |
